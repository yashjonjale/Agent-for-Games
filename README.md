# Classic-Othello

# Intelligent Othello Agent

Welcome to the Intelligent Othello Agent project. In this project, I have developed a classic Othello (also known as Reversi) game implemented in C++, complete with a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) opponent.

- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI opponent is powered by the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental technique in AI for decision-making in adversarial environments.

- **Command-Line Interface**: Play the game using a simple and intuitive command-line interface, making it accessible to all users.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the C++ code.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the intelligent AI.
